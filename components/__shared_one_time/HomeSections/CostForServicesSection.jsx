              How Much Does Commercial & Residential Cleaning Service Cost
            </h2>
            <p className="text-xs lg:text-base mt-2 lg:mt-[15px] lg:leading-[32px]">
              The cost of commercial & residential cleaning services varies
              depending on various factors such as the size of the space, the
              frequency of cleaning, and the specific services required.
              Generally, commercial cleaning services tend to be more expensive
              than residential ones due to the larger areas and specialized
              equipment often involved. Ultimately, the best way to determine
              the cost of cleaning services for either commercial or residential
              properties is to request quotes from multiple cleaning websites
              and compare their services and pricing structures. Additionally,
              considering factors like the reputation of the company, their
              level of experience, and the quality of their work can help ensure
              that you get the best value for your money.
